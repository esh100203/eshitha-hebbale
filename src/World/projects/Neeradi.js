      <div class="nr_context_text">
        <p>Neeradi emerges from the quiet longing of a landscape that once lived in intimate dialogue with the Hemavathi River. Historically, the Hemavathi River supported settlements along its banks due to fertile alluvial soil, seasonal floods and easy access to water. These settlements formed cultural ecosystems where the river held physical, visual and spiritual significance in daily life.</p>
        <p>This equilibrium was profoundly altered by the construction of the Gorur Dam in 1970s. The regulation and storage of water transformed the river's natural rhythms, replacing cyclical seasonal flooding with controlled releases and unpredictable man-made inundations.</p>
        <p>To understand this layered relationship, mappings and paintings were developed to read the river's changing terrain, seasonal water levels and emotional memory.</p>

            <p>These settlements weren't just functional but they were cultural ecosystems where the river held a visual, physical, and spiritual presence in everyday life.</p>
            <p>The construction of the Hemavathi dam altered this equilibrium. Its large reservoir demanded a re-engineering of the river's natural course, even cutting through or reshaping parts of the Western Ghats.</p>
            <p>Water, which once flowed freely, now became regulated and stored, distorting the natural ecosystem.</p>
            <p>As a result, man-made floods replaced natural ones, occurring unpredictably when water was released from the dam, submerging downstream settlements. This unpredictability led to the abandonment of settlements along the riverbanks, breaking the age-old pattern of riverine habitation.</p>
            <p>This transformed the identity of the river from once a source of life and stability, into a source triggering fear.</p>
            <p>Now, between Hemavathi and KRS dams, the entire river stretch shows no significant habitation which is a stark contradiction to historical patterns of rivers settlement.</p>

          The documentation implies the need for adaptable and scalable systems that can transform with changing conditions, much like the community's own adaptive practices of reclaiming and releasing land with each flood. The river's edge is not a singular site but a network of interactions—ritual, ecology, and memory interwoven. Architectural implications thus move toward networked spatial systems, where small, dispersed, and interconnected interventions sustain the larger landscape narrative. Drawing from the cyclic nature of the river, structures are conceived to transform, disappear or re-emerge with seasonal shifts.

Historically dependent on the river for agriculture and daily needs, the village's interaction with the waterbody was drastically reshaped post-dam, with new settlements and altered access to water resources.</p>

            <p>A spiritual energy mapping traces the patterns of movement and gathering across different times of the day. The Temple, Market Space and Community Space emerged as primary nodes of activity, informing the placement of ancillary pavilions. Their locations were further refined through the site's terrain, hydrology, vegetation and visual connections, creating a framework that responds simultaneously to human activity, ecological systems and the cultural landscape.</p>
            <p>The design strategy draws from the understanding that permanence along the Hemavathi has always been an illusion. Here, architecture becomes an act of negotiation rather than control. Conceived as a constellation of pavilions, mandapas, markets, ghats and community spaces woven between the temple and the river, the intervention unfolds as a gradual journey through a landscape of thresholds. Programs emerge from the life of the village itself which included ritual gatherings, seasonal markets, statue offerings, communal celebrations, rest and observation. Movement through the site is shaped by seasonal water calendars, spiritual energy fields and collective memory, transforming the riverfront into a living archive of stories, rituals and return.</p>
